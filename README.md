#Bamazon 

This app was designed to learn/explore the features of Node.js combined with a MySQL database.  
The bamazonCustomer.js file allows the customer to choose and item by its ID number and select a number to buy between 1-10.
The bamazonManager.js file allows the Manager to view the inventory, view low inventory (quantity less than 5), add to the inventory of an item, and add a new product all together.
